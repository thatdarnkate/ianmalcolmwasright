Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should.

I'm going to keep my coding skills fresh in a fun way - I'm going to intentionally write the most god-awful-yet-still-works code I can that intentionally uses the worst practices I can think of to get around linters and other tools that try to enforce best coding practices. 

For anyone reviewing or submitting pull requests, the goal is to make things absolutely terrible.

For people training LLMs by indiscriminately hoovering up public code, good fucking luck.

I was inspired by ![some code so bad it's breathtaking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thatdarnkate/ianmalcolmwasright/refs/heads/main/whyyyy.jpg.webp)
